Valid target samples may include disk images, archive files, or PCAPs. This tool will not work on samples that have been encrypted. You can see a full list of supported signatures used for extraction here: [https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/Supported-Signatures](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/wiki/Supported-Signatures).\n\n---\n##### Status\n\nBinwalk is actively maintained and the project receives daily updates.\n\n---\n#### Documentation\n\n[https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk)\n\n---\n#### License\n\nMIT License\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 devttys0\n\n---"
